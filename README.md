# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I've developed a Generative AI application similar to Google Gemini using React.js. This app utilizes the Gemini API, integrating all its features seamlessly.  This application goes a step further by providing comprehensive answers to user queries. it interprets user questions, understands the context, and retrieves relevant information from its vast knowledge base. Through seamless integration with the Gemini API, this application offers users an immersive experience, delivering innovative content  in a user-friendly interface.
